# Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling of customer churn, which is a critical issue for businesses aiming to retain their customer base.

## Project Overview

Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time. Understanding and predicting churn can help businesses take proactive steps to retain valuable customers. In this project, we explore various machine learning models to predict churn and provide insights into the factors contributing to it.

### Key Features:
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends related to customer churn.
- **Modeling:** Implementing multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict customer churn.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize and reduce the feature space.
